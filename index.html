                Welcome to my blog!
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is my personal blog where I will share whatever I feel is worthy of a online post. These pages are static
                but there may be a comment section in the future if people ask for it :). I do not claim to hold any super profound opinions,
                and honestly the writing will be above average, so exit now if you are expecting a young Hemingway. 
            
                <br>
                <br>
                The topics I plan on providing my opinion and commentary on are:

            <ul>
                <li> Tech - My projects and interesting developments </li>
                <li> Life </li>
                <li> Food </li>
                <li> Economics </li>
            </ul>
